# Sardana Documentation Camp Ideas

In this document we put the ideas for the Sardana Documentation Camp. Later 
on we will discuss them on the follow-up meeting in order to prepare the format 
and agenda of the camp.

* We could invide (e.g. video call) some users so they comment on how they see
the current documentation.

* Video demos
    * If there is some time during the camp we could record some videos 
    (screen capture) with the demos.
    * We have already some videos, maybe we could create a YouTube 
    channel and upload them there.
    
* Merge DESY documentation in the official one
    * We could extract the generic information from this docs and move them 
    to the official docs.

* Many features will require documenting Taurus cause Sardana heavily 
depends on Taurus.

* Move from ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages
    * This would allow us to get rid of the mocks.
    * Taurus is already in GithHub Pages, we could reuse its configuration.
    
* Features missing in the Sardana documentation
    * MacroServer environment variables (only scan related variables are 
    documented)
    * New Spock syntax for repeat parameters
    * Spock magic commands
    * Continuous Scans
    * Macro Logging
    * General Hooks
    * Configuration Tools

* Documentation that needs review
   * [Scan hooks](http://www.sardana-controls.org/en/latest/devel/howto_macros/scan_framework.html#sardana-macros-scanframework). Make clear the difference between the hooks from the Hooks API and the generator from GSF.


* Documentation of the macros in the macro catalogue is duplicated. We need 
to find a way on how to reuse the macro classes/functions docstrings.
